## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Input tasks through a form and add them to the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Click on a task to toggle its completed status.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks using a delete button.
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved to `localStorage` and reloaded upon revisiting the page.
